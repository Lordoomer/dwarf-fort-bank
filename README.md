# dwarf-fort-bank

This project's goal is to allow players to park Dwarf Fortress Regions in slots on a website so that other players can then download it, play on it then re-upload the region and someone else or the original creator could then download it again and keep improvings the forts in that region and so on. It's the best I can do for now instead of a real multuiplayer mod.

This only works with node version 0.13 or older because I use the formidable module which got deprecated in later ones. If no one can run it without my colleciton of old modules then make me know somehow and I'll gladly post em to you. My email is doomer666@hotmail.co.uk and my textnow is 1-579-500-2798 contact me if need informations or help.
